# Type/Code Development Excercise

##### FONTS:
- Copernicus is converted for use as a webfont in the Fonts folder
- The other fonts (Futura and Palatino) can be used w/o webfont as Mac includes a version of both pre-installed. Make sure to specify fallback fonts for non-Macs though.

##### ASSETS:
- SVGs of the logo, icons, and the background image are provided in the Assets folder 

##### NOTE:
- The only element that has the ‘masking’ effect revealing the background behind is the large title
